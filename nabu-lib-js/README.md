## Installation
To use the NABU library, you need to include the nabu.js file in your project. You can download the file and place it in your project directory. Then, you can import the library in your JavaScript code using the following syntax:

## Usage
Here is an example of how to use NABU library:

```javascript
   import { NABU } from './nabu.js';
```

## Usage
Once you have imported the NABU library, you can start using its functions and methods to create and manipulate HTML elements. Here are some examples:

## Creating elements in the head
You can use the NABU.head() method to create elements in the <head> section of your HTML document. It accepts an object representing the elements to be created. Each key in the object represents the HTML tag name, and the corresponding value represents the attributes and child elements of that tag. For example:

```javascript
NABU.head({
    title: {
        text: 'Document'
    },
    meta: {
        charset: 'UTF-8'
    }
});
```


## Creating elements in the body
Similarly, you can use the NABU.body() method to create elements in the <body> section of your HTML document. It follows the same syntax as NABU.head(). Additionally, you can provide attributes for the parent element as the second argument. For example:

```javascript
NABU.body(
    {
        div: {
            id: 'loginPage',
            class: 'loginPage',
            child: [
                {
                    form: {
                        id: 'loginForm',
                        class: 'loginForm',
                        child: [
                            {
                                h2: {
                                    id: 'h2hayder',
                                    text: 'hayder zaeem',
                                },
                            },
                            // Other child elements...
                        ],
                    },
                },
            ],
        },
    },
    {
        id: 'hayder',
        style: {
            margin: '0px',
            background: '#ccc'
        }
    }
);
```

## Importing data from a file
The NABU.getFiler() method allows you to import data from a file. It accepts the file path and the name of the function to be executed. For example:

```javascript
NABU.getFiler('../path', 'name function');

```

## Creating child elements
You can use the NABU.child() method to create child elements. It accepts an array of objects, where each object represents a child element to be created. For example:

```javascript
NABU.child([
    {
        h2: {
            id: 'id1',
            text: 'hayder zaeem',
        }
    },
    // Other child elements...
]);

```
## Creating a single element
You can use the NABU.element() method to create a single element. It follows the same syntax as NABU.body() but creates only one element. For example:

```javascript
NABU.element({
    div: {
        id: 'loginPage',
        class: 'loginPage',
        child: [
            {
                h2: {
                    id: 'id1',
                    text: 'hayder zaeem',
                }
            }
        ]
    }
});

```
